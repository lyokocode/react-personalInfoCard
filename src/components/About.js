            <p>
                Hello, I'm Aelita from Lyoko. I live in Ä°zmir city and I will be frontend developer <br />
                I studied in veterinary faculty. I've been interested in software for a while <br />
                I am a free spirited person. I am progressing in this field because I do not want to work depending on location. I like solo trekking and cycling.
            </p>
